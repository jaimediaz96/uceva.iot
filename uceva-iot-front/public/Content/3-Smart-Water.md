# THIS IS A PICE OF AN ARTICULE, REAL POST ON [LINK](https://ubidots.com/blog/smart-water-leveraging-iot-for-water-monitoring-and-management/)

We need water. As obvious as that is, we sometimes take it for granted and forget that turning the tap on and getting plenty of this essential resource is a luxury that millions of people around the world don’t enjoy. Whether it’s for human or animal consumption, agriculture, recreation, or power generation, water defines our lives and its management is becoming increasingly important for public and private institutions alike.

That’s why all efforts put into the preservation of water are of great significance and technologies like IoT are already making important contributions to this end. IoT technology can provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for water monitoring, allowing real-time data to be collected and analyzed remotely. In this article, we'll explore how IoT is being used for different types of water monitoring and the benefits it offers.

## Water quality monitoring

Few combinations are as disastrous as having all living organisms depend on water and then getting that water heavily polluted with all sorts of chemicals, plastics, waste, and even radioactive materials. This combination results in health issues, contaminated agricultural products, ecosystems that are negatively altered, and economic losses.

That’s why monitoring water quality, as part of broader strategies, is a critical step in preventing and mitigating these negative consequences, and IoT has already proved its worth in this field by providing real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization. These are some of the variables that are analyzed as part of a water quality monitoring solution:

1. **pH monitoring:** pH monitoring keeps track of the acidity or alkalinity of water. pH affects the solubility of nutrients and heavy metals, and can also impact aquatic life.
2. **Dissolved oxygen monitoring:** Dissolved oxygen levels are critical for aquatic life, and monitoring them can help to detect problems such as low oxygen levels due to pollution, algae blooms, or other factors.
3. **Turbidity monitoring:** Turbidity refers to the level of cloudiness or haziness in water caused by suspended particles. High turbidity levels can make water unsafe for consumption, and monitoring it is critical for ensuring water quality.
4. **Temperature monitoring:** Temperature affects many aspects of water quality, including dissolved oxygen levels, and nutrient availability.
5. **Salinity monitoring:** Salinity levels can impact aquatic life, crop growth, and the effectiveness of irrigation systems.

IoT has improved water quality monitoring by providing real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization that paints a better picture for analysts and enables faster, more accurate actions to be taken.

## Water management

Water reaches our infrastructure and the problem shifts from keeping it clean to using it efficiently. Water leaks can go undetected for long periods and end up adding several hundred dollars to the bills, or even causing major structural damage that results in about one in 60 insured homes having a property damage claim caused by water damage or freezing each year and an average property damage of USD 11,650.

Not only that, though—with droughts becoming an increasing reality for many places around the world (let’s not forget South Africa’s recent water crisis), efficient use of water is not just a matter of personal finance, but a social issue that requires every bit of commitment and innovation.

That’s why thousands of commercial buildings across the world are starting to benefit from the implementation of IoT solutions that help them identify and monitor their water consumption in real time.

At the center of these solutions lie devices such as pulse loggers that keep an eye on water meters and track water flow. Thanks to connectivity technologies such as Wi-Fi or LoRaWAN, these devices can then forward the collected data to platforms such as Ubidots, where the building manager can observe the consumption trends, set up alerts to be notified of any anomaly, and even run custom functions to analyze historical data.

Other devices that make up these solutions are water leak detectors, which, as their name suggests, are in charge of either sensing water that has leaked on a monitored surface or detecting anomalies in the flow and pressure of water. There are three main types of devices in this category:

1. **Flood sensor:** these devices alert the user when they come in contact with water, and therefore, if strategically placed, can be a good method to detect leaks early on.
2. **Flow meter:** these devices are installed within the plumbing system and track flow rate and water pressure. Deviations in these variables picked up by the device (or the overall IoT solution) are recognized as leaks with a high degree of accuracy.
3. **Ultrasonic leak detector:** these devices are installed over the plumbing system (no pipe cutting required) and, using ultrasonic technology, track water consumption to find anomalies, as in the case of the flow meters.

## Water level monitoring

In the form of rivers, lakes, and dams, water defines and shapes our cities, like a moving landmark that can both embellish and wreak havoc on them. Increasingly common flooding (one of multiple effects of climate change) endangers entire communities around the world each year, resulting in **ruinous loss of life and devastation**.

With so much on the line, it’s no surprise that IoT is being used by private and public institutions to aid in the mitigation of damage caused by floods.

For example, **Peclet Technology**, an Australian company specializing in smart cities, is **helping local councils monitor the level of creeks and rivers**. The data, collected and made publicly available through Ubidots, is used to inform residents, businesses, and state emergency services about the risk of flooding.

On a smaller scale, there are also level devices that can keep track of tanks and troughs to provide real-time insights into the rate of water use and the need for refills. These devices, which are particularly useful in agriculture, are designed to endure outdoor conditions and not bother animals when they drink. A simple setup combining these devices with Ubidots can ensure animal welfare thanks to timely alerts and intuitive visualizations.

## Water monitoring in agriculture

Moving away from the cities and into the countryside, water becomes essential for every agricultural activity we depend on. All the problems we've covered in this post take a different form when it comes to agriculture—and while droughts and floods are certainly the most destructive for this industry (costing it USD 58 billion, combined, in the measured period), things like the water quality, its efficient use, and its general availability (beyond droughts, that is) result critical for day-to-day operations.

For instance, providing water to cattle or crops in far-off fields can be a multi-layered logistical challenge that could entail, among other things, accessing underground aquifers and setting up pump systems to extract the water.
